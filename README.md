## Design Decisions & Assumptions

1. Authentication is not implemented in the current version
2. Working hours are set to:
   - Monday to Friday
   - Morning: 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM
   - Afternoon: 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM
3. Appointments are fixed at 30-minute intervals
4. All times are handled in 24-hour format
5. The system uses local timezone for simplicity
6. Appointment slots are currently handled in-memory (no backend persistence)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/LASHETTY/BabySteps-Appointment-System-Assignment1.git>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Usage

1. Browse the list of available doctors on the home page
2. Click "Book Appointment" for your chosen doctor
3. Select an available date from the calendar
4. Choose a time slot from the available options
5. Fill in your personal information
6. Submit the booking form
7. Receive confirmation via toast notification

## Project Status

This is the frontend implementation of the BabySteps Appointment Booking System. Currently, the application stores data in-memory and provides a complete user interface for booking appointments. Backend integration for data persistence can be implemented in future iterations.
